# What are we watching tonight?
## The concept
The difficulty in modern times is that you can't find things to watch because you can't find something that's similar to something that you like, or there are just too many options. I have seen this need and created the world's most beautiful web page, in which you do a search for a movie that you know you already like, and it produces similar results.
## Features
I have a cutting edge input form where you search for a movie you like. The similar results come up and are inserted into a carousel. There's a scrolling div at the bottom where the movie overview is available to be able to read a description of the films as you go through them.
## MVP
I wanted to be able to handle data from an API to display similar results when inputting a movie title.
## Technical details
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and AJAX in order to use an API I found via The Movie Database to return the information that I desired. 
## Technical challenges
For a fledgling programmer like myself, AJAX functions in order to handle data are difficult to utilize. There's also the issue of scope and putting everything in the right order to be able to trickle the data through in a usable manner.
## Planned improvements
I'm going to be overhauling this entire page after the course so I can have it search for specific parameters(genre, director, main actor, decade, language, etc) instead of just using the "find similar" function that the API provided. I'd like either a dropdown or radio buttons to select the desired parameters, and I'd like to add a "play trailer" button, or have it able to click the poster to bring up the trailer.
